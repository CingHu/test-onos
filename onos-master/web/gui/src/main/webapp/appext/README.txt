The 'appext' directory is for "Application Extensions". That is to say,
this would be the path to applications contributing to the GUI.

Note that these applications are 'external' to the base GUI, i.e. would
be built and packaged in separate .jar/.war file. They would be installed
via server-side injection.

This directory is just a placeholder to reserve the path.
